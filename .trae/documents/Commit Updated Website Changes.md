## Scope
- Commit recent website updates: favicon fixes, responsive profile image, and folder cleanup.

## Steps
- Verify repository and current branch: check git status, branch, and remotes.
- Stage all changes: additions, modifications, and deletions (including removal of `www.theabhisheksinha.com/`).
- Commit with a clear message summarizing favicon standardization and responsive image changes.
- Push to the current branch if a remote exists; otherwise, leave the commit locally.

## Commit Message
- Title: "Website: favicon standardization + responsive profile image"
- Body: absolute asset paths, cache-busted SVG, PNG primary favicon, Apple/mask icons, srcset for hero image, removed duplicate `www.theabhisheksinha.com/` folder.

## Validation
- Re-check status to confirm a clean working tree.
- If push succeeds, report remote/branch; if no remote, report local commit hash.
